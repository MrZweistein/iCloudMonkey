### iCloudMonkey - _no see evil iCloud application window_

**What is this application for?**

Under Windows and the circumstance you have installed iCloud there, a iCloud popup window appears on your desktop. The Window appears with the start of Windows and on other occations and there is currently now way I know of to surpress that. 

This is why I developed this app which monitors the windows desktop if an new window opens on the desktop. If it is the bespoke iCloud Window the window is supressed without ending the application.

**How iCloudMonkey is installed and started?**

Copy the files stored in the ZIP to any folder you like and start iCloudMonkey from there. The app starts into the tray. In the tray you can mouse click for the menu. If you set the "Auto Start" option iCloudMonkey will start with windows. If you change the location please make sure to disable "Auto Start" before doing so.

**What are the menu options  of iCloudMonkey?**

1. _Pause / Resume_: In case you actually want the iCould Window to persist select "Pause" which will pause the surpression of the iCloud window.  After having selected "Pause" the menu item changes to "Resume" which then can be selected to continue the supression of the iCloud window popup.
2.  _Auto Start_: If you select this menu item the first time the app will be added to your list of auto staring applications that start with Windows. You can see a checkmark if the setting is active. To disable that setting just selct the same menu item while the checkmark is visible.
3. _Info_: Select this menu item to see the application information window that also tells you how many iCloud Windows were already supressed. The window closes on its own.
4. _Exit_: Select this menu item to end and exit the application. Thge application will be removed from the system tray.
